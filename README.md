# LaucnhBar Action to search/list Swift Evolution Proposals

Inspired by https://oleb.net/blog/2023/alfred-swift-evolution/ this is a copy of the Alfred workflow, slighlty adjusted for LaunchBar.


## Testing


To try the script manually (in `~/Library/Application
Support/LaunchBar/Actions/SwiftEvolutionProposals.lbaction`):

Run:

```
swift Contents/Scripts/default.swift collection
```

Where `collection` is an argument for the script. 
This is the argument passed to the script when a search query is entered into LaunchBar.
